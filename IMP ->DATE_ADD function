Q:Write a solution to find all dates' id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).



SELECT w1.id
FROM Weather AS w1
JOIN Weather AS w2 ON w1.recordDate = DATE_ADD(w2.recordDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY)
WHERE w1.temperature > w2.temperature;
//DATE_ADD adds one day in w2.daterecord
